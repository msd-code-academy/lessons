## Community

We believe in giving back to the community. We are group of people who would like to see even more junior and senior developers to start using React.

For any questions related to the Academy or its content we created **Slack room**.
Join it and ask us about JavaScript, React, Redux, Webpack, API and lot more. Are you struggling with homeworks for next lesson or any other issues? Don't worry and let us help you.
